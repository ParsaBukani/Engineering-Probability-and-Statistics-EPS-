# Transformations of Random Variables

_Engineering Probability and Statistics – University of Tehran_

This project explores the concept of transforming random variables, specifically focusing on transformations such as the **logarithmic transformation** and the **Box-Muller transform**. The project involves using these transformations to convert distributions, such as from a **Uniform Distribution** to an **Exponential Distribution** and from **Uniform Distribution** to **Normal Distribution**.

The project is implemented using **R**, and it includes simulations to verify the transformations and analyze the results.

## Objectives

- Understand and implement transformations of random variables.
- Use the **logarithmic transformation** to convert a **Uniform Distribution** to an **Exponential Distribution**.
- Use the **Box-Muller transform** to convert two independent **Uniform Distributions** into two independent **Normal Distributions**.
- Simulate the transformed variables and compare the results with theoretical expectations.

## Tasks

1. **Simulate Uniform Distribution**:
   - Generate random samples from a **Uniform Distribution**.

2. **Logarithmic Transformation**:
   - Apply the logarithmic transformation to convert the uniform samples into **Exponential Distribution** samples.

3. **Exponential Distribution**:
   - Plot the histogram of the transformed samples and compare the results with the theoretical **Exponential Distribution**.

4. **Box-Muller Transform**:
   - Use the Box-Muller transform to generate two independent standard **Normal Distributions** from two independent **Uniform Distributions**.

5. **Normal Distribution**:
   - Plot the histograms of the transformed **Normal Distributions** and compare them with the theoretical **Standard Normal Distribution**.
