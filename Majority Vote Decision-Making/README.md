# Majority Vote Decision-Making

_Engineering Probability and Statistics – University of Tehran_

This project explores the concept of **Majority Vote**, a decision-making process where the choice receiving more than half of the votes is selected as the final decision. This method is widely used in democratic systems, group decision-making, and various machine learning algorithms.

## Objectives

- Investigate how Majority Vote affects decision accuracy.
- Simulate and calculate the accuracy of Majority Vote in various scenarios.
- Analyze the impact of the probability of correct decisions on overall accuracy.
- Visualize results using simulations and heatmaps.

## Tasks

1. **Scenario Analysis**: Write a function to calculate the probability of correct majority decisions under different voting scenarios (given the probability of correct decisions).
   
2. **Impact of Accuracy**: Simulate and investigate the effect of varying individual voting accuracy (from 0 to 1) on the overall accuracy of the majority vote with 12 voters.

3. **Optimal Accuracy**: Determine the optimal individual accuracy value (the minimum probability required for 100% accuracy in the majority vote).

4. **Heatmap Visualization**: Use a heatmap to visualize the relationship between the number of voters and individual decision accuracy, showing how these factors affect overall decision-making accuracy.
