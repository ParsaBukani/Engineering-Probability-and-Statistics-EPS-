# Hypergeometric Distribution

_Engineering Probability and Statistics – University of Tehran_

This project focuses on the **Hypergeometric Distribution**, a probability distribution used to model the number of successes in a sample drawn without replacement. The project involves simulating the process of auditing an election to detect fraudulent districts and comparing the results with theoretical calculations.

The project is implemented using **R**, and it covers various tasks related to the simulation of the hypergeometric distribution, its theoretical and empirical properties, and visualizations of the results.

## Objectives

- Simulate the **Hypergeometric Distribution** for the process of detecting fraudulent districts in an election.
- Calculate the theoretical mean and variance of the distribution.
- Compare the simulated and theoretical results by plotting them and analyzing the discrepancies.
- Explore the effect of different sample sizes and parameters on the distribution.

## Tasks

1. **Simulation of the Hypergeometric Distribution**:
   - Simulate the election auditing process with 150 samples.
   - Visualize the distribution of the number of fraudulent districts detected.

2. **Empirical vs. Theoretical Values**:
   - Implement a function that calculates the theoretical and simulated mean and variance for sample sizes ranging from 100 to 10000.
   - Compare the theoretical and empirical values using graphs.

3. **Effect of Sample Size**:
   - Investigate the effect of different sample sizes (m = 40, 60, 80, 100) on the distribution and simulate the corresponding distributions.
   - Plot the results and analyze the variations.

4. **Comparison with the Binomial Distribution**:
   - Study the relationship between the **Hypergeometric** and **Binomial** distributions as the population size (N) grows large.
   - Compare the two distributions and report the results.

5. **PMF Calculation for Both Distributions**:
   - Implement a function to calculate the **PMF** for both the Hypergeometric and Binomial distributions for different values of the random variable.
   - Visualize the **PMF** for different population sizes.

6. **Visual Comparison of Distributions**:
   - For different values of N, compare the Hypergeometric and Binomial distributions by plotting their **PMF** curves on the same graph.
