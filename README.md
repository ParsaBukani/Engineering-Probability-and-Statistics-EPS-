# Engineering Probability and Statistics (EPS)

This repository contains a series of projects developed for the course  
**“Engineering Probability and Statistics (EPS)”**, offered by the  
**Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering**,  
**University of Tehran – Fall 1403**,  
under the supervision of **Dr. Tavassolipour** and **Dr. Vahabi**.

## Overview

The projects apply probability and statistics to simulation and data analysis, including:
- Random variables & distributions (Binomial, Hypergeometric, Normal, Exponential, Geometric)
- Sampling distributions & the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**
- **Bayesian estimation** (Beta–Bernoulli updating)
- **Naive Bayes** text classification
- **Majority vote** accuracy and ensemble effects
- **MSE**-based estimation (linear regression, geometric center)
- Transformations of variables (log transform, **Box–Muller**)
- Joint/conditional analysis, correlation vs. causation, and visualization
