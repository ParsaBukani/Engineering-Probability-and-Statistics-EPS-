# Spam Email Detection

_Engineering Probability and Statistics – University of Tehran_

The goal of this project is to classify emails as either **spam** or **non-spam** using **Bayes' Theorem**. We will process a dataset of labeled emails and apply techniques like **Bag of Words** (BoW) to build a spam classifier.

## Objectives

- Preprocess email data for text classification.
- Build a **Bag of Words** model for feature extraction.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Apply **Naive Bayes Classifier** to predict if an email is spam or not.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy and improve it using techniques like Laplace Smoothing and Stop Words removal.

## Steps

1. **Preprocessing Data**: Clean and prepare the email content by removing unwanted characters, normalizing text, and handling stopwords.
2. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert email text data into a numerical representation using the **Bag of Words** technique.
4. **Model Training**: Train a **Naive Bayes** classifier using the training set.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the classifier's performance on the test set.
